If you are wondering **how to extract URLs from any webpage**, for free, really fast you are in the right place!

**1. Extract URLs from webpages with addons:**

I can reccomend a really powerful Chrome addon called [Link Klipper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/link-klipper-extract-all/fahollcgofmpnehocdgofnhkkchiekoo?hl=en)

![Link-Klipper](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61537859/114427036-f9acb600-9bba-11eb-9c39-badb724132b5.jpeg)


This extension allows you to :
- Extract all the links on the webpage
- Store all the extracted links as a CSV file
- Custom drag a selectable area on the webpage from which all the links will be extracted


**2. Extract URLs from webpages with the terminal:**


That¬¥s what you¬¥ll need to do the magic:

- MAC
- termnial
- wget installed




First of all check if you already installed wget by running the following command:
```
$ wget -V
```
If it is not installed yet then install 
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) first:
```
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Then you need to install wget:
```
$ brew install wget
```

Now you got everything you need to **extract URLs from a webpage** for free with only one single command:
```
$ wget --mirror --delete-after --no-directories https://www.the-page-you-wanna-crawl.com 2>&1 | grep '^--' | awk '{print $3}' | sort >extracted-URLs.txt
```

The command will export all the URLs in a txt file called extracted-URLs.txt (if you want you can also rename it).
