If you are wondering how to extract sitemap URLs really fast you are in the right place!

There are different options out there and I selected the best 3 methods:

- Google Sheets
- Screaming Frog
- Terminal
- Let’s jump right into it.

1) Extract URLs From XML Sitemaps Online In Google Sheets


Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
