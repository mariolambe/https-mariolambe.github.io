If you are wondering how to extract sitemap URLs really fast you are in the right place!

There are different options out there and I selected the best 3 methods:

- Google Sheets
- Screaming Frog
- Terminal
- Let’s jump right into it.



**1) Extract URLs From XML Sitemaps Online In Google Sheets**

I found a simple sitemap url extractor script that will extract the list of URLs from the Sitemap in Google Sheets in less than 5 seconds, pretty impressive, isn’t it? Give it a try.

[Here the Google Sheet that act as a sitemap url extractor:](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U549m-mcSHIwebpMzjDr3s5ggO95LAnf7YbccrwUkoE/copy)


1. Make a copy of it

2. Add the sitemap URL in the cell B2 (example: https://www.google.com/sheets/sitemaps.xml)

3. The list of URLs will appear automatically in column D

4. Done! You have just converted your sitemap to a URL list.

**2) Extract URLs From XML Sitemaps with Screaming Frog**

For this second method you need to install the SEO software Screaming Frog to convert any sitemap xml to a url list. This method works pretty well also for sitemap index file that are the ones that contain list of sub-sitemaps.
