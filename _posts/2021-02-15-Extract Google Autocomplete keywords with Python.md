Python is becoming one of the most popular programming languages when it comes to SEO tasks automation.

People use Python for many different purposes and here you can find a good tutorial if you want to learn more about it.

With this post I will teach you how to extract keywords from Google autocomplete using Python for Keyword Research Opportunities. 

You can run Python from your terminal or cloud-based alternatives such as:

Jupyter Notebooks.
Google Colab.
If you need to share the script with colleagues or friend I would then recommend Google Colab.

The python code is ready to be used, you only need to add as many keywords as you want in the list_a following the same structure.

Example:

`{% jupyter_notebook "googlesuggest.ipynb" %}`
