Hi, my name is Mario!

I have 6+ years’ experience in SEO and currently I am  Senior SEO Manager at Zalando SE in Germany.

I’ve worked on the organic expansion and the definition of SEO requirements of 18+ domains at Zalando.

Strong focus on strategies to increase rankings, from technical SEO to link acquisition and content strategies in line with company’s goals.
